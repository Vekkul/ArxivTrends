# ArXiv Research Trends Analyzer

## Overview

This is a Streamlit-based web application that analyzes research paper trends and patterns from the arXiv repository using natural language processing and interactive data visualizations. The application enables users to search for academic papers by category, perform text analysis on abstracts and titles, and visualize publication trends, authorship patterns, and research topic distributions through interactive charts and graphs.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: Streamlit for rapid web app development with built-in UI components
- **Visualization Library**: Plotly for interactive charts and graphs with built-in zoom, pan, and hover functionality
- **Layout**: Wide layout with expandable sidebar for search parameters and controls
- **Session State**: Streamlit session state management for persisting data across user interactions

### Backend Architecture
- **Modular Design**: Component-based architecture with separate modules for distinct responsibilities:
  - `ArxivClient`: Handles API interactions with arXiv's REST API
  - `TextAnalyzer`: Performs NLP tasks using NLTK and scikit-learn
  - `DataProcessor`: Transforms raw paper data into structured pandas DataFrames
  - `Visualizations`: Creates interactive Plotly visualizations
- **Data Flow**: Papers retrieved → processed into DataFrames → analyzed with NLP → visualized with Plotly
- **Rate Limiting**: Built-in request throttling to respect arXiv API guidelines (3-second delays)

### Data Processing Pipeline
- **Data Sources**: arXiv API XML responses parsed into structured dictionaries
- **Text Processing**: NLTK-based preprocessing including tokenization, stopword removal, and lemmatization
- **Feature Extraction**: TF-IDF vectorization for text analysis and topic modeling
- **Machine Learning**: K-means clustering and Latent Dirichlet Allocation for topic discovery
- **Data Storage**: In-memory pandas DataFrames with session state persistence

### Text Analysis Capabilities
- **Preprocessing**: Custom stopword lists including domain-specific academic terms
- **NLP Pipeline**: Tokenization, POS tagging, lemmatization using NLTK
- **Topic Modeling**: LDA implementation for discovering research themes
- **Clustering**: K-means clustering for grouping similar papers
- **Statistical Analysis**: Word frequency analysis, text length metrics, and keyword extraction

### Visualization Strategy
- **Interactive Charts**: Plotly-based timeline plots, distribution charts, and network graphs
- **Real-time Updates**: Dynamic chart generation based on user selections and filters
- **Export Capabilities**: Built-in Plotly export options for PNG, PDF, and HTML formats
- **Responsive Design**: Charts automatically adjust to different screen sizes
